# Jacobi coordinates
 
Those *Drift* and the first half of *Kick* steps are easier calculated using Jacobi coordinates, which use the barycenter of the masses that influence the orbit as the center of the coordinates.

So, the following functions perform a numerically stable transformation between cartesian and jacobi coordinates.
